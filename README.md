# React Weather-App
## Built using react-bootstrap for template
## Note: Using two different ways to fetch APIs and displaying them (for learning reasons). One way is fetching the APIs in same file as displaying data, the other way is by building fetching componentents and sending data through props for displaying the data.

## To start the app, first run "npm install"(install the dependencies) then use "npm start" to run the app in the browser.
